; An FSM is one of:
; - '()
; - (cons Transition FSM)

(define-struct transition [current next])
; A Transition is a structure:
;   (make-transition FSM-State FSM-State)

; FSM-State is a Color.

; interpretation: An FSM represents the transitions that a finite state machine can take from one
; state to another in reaction to keystrokes
